# Tumor Motion Analysis
Welcome to the Tumour Motion Analysis Repository! This repository is dedicated to the in-depth motion analysis of mobile lung cancer tumours. The project encompasses various algorithms and techniques to quantify motion, including Centre of Mass Displacement, Image Deformation, Volume Tracking, and a Voxel-Wise Motion Analysis. The algorithms can be implemented for any applications where motion is described by sequential timed snapshots representations. In our example we analyse tumour motion from 4D Computed-Tomography (4D-CT) scans of the thorax region. This repository provides valuable tools and insights for the comprehensive analysis of tumor motion in the context of radiation therapy and radiation treatment planning.
