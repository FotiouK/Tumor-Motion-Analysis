# Tumor Motion Analysis

Welcome to the Tumour Motion Analysis Repository! This repository is dedicated to the in-depth analysis of tumour motion, with a primary focus on mobile lung cancer tumours. Our project encompasses various algorithms and techniques, including Centre of Mass Displacement, Image Deformation, Volume Tracking, and Voxel-Wise Motion Analysis. These algorithms can be implemented for a wide range of motion analysis applications where motion is described by timed snapshots of the body. In our example, we analyse tumor motion using 4D Computed-Tomography scans of the thorax region. This repository provides valuable tools and insights for the comprehensive analysis of tumor motion in the context of radiation therapy and radiation treatment planning.
